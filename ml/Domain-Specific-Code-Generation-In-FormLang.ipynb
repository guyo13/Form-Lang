    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "AI and LLM systems are being trained to perform a variety of complex tasks requiring expertise in many software tools, languages and technology stacks. Some of the challenges in this process involve quality data acquisition in large amounts, handling the increase of model parameter count which leads to increasing compute demands and costs, as well as emerging Data Privacy and Intellctual Property concerns related with using 3rd party cloud services for model training. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this work we attempt to harness and combine the benefits of Abstraction and Determinism provided by Formal Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) with the innate ability of LLMs to learn new languages and their semantics. We propose a novel generation task called \"Domain Specific Code Generation\" which involve mapping user requests written in natural language to DSL code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing a specially crafted DSL called `FormLang` as a case study, we attempt to lay the groundwork for methods of automated DSL dataset generation, training techniques and performance evaluation, with the end goal of creating an AI system capable of generating Web forms according to a user request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `FormLang` DSL allows expressing the semantics of Web-forms using a simplified syntax that does not require much, if any, Web-programming knowledge and expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a user prompt in English describing the desired form and its fields the LLM produces syntactically valid `FormLang` output which is run through the accompanying FormLang parser and a hand-crafted React JSX compiler to output a final implementation of the form in JavaScript and React.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project includes a live demo which demonstrates the capabilities of the system.\n"

    "    * **(TBD)** Users input a prompt.\n",
    "    * **(TBD)** A FormLang editor is populated with the AI’s code generation results.\n",
    "    * **(TBD)** The form is rendered alongside the generated code.\n",
    "*  Discuss the project results:\n",
    "    * Perfornace and user acceptability.\n",
    "    * **(TBD)** Viability of the implemented methods for the Domain Specific Code Generation task and generalization to other domains.  \n",
